Since I'm using CubeIDE, which creates a lot of uninteresting and unnecessary folders, I'll only add folders where something had to be changed for the sake of the project. 
I chose this project for the reasons of learning in a different environment than basic arduino and also who doesn't enjoy flying, UAV systems and so on?
